More and more sites are implementing the new hcaptcha (Cloudflare, ehem). If you are tired of wasting your time, selecting images, making mistakes and having to start over, this method is for you:

1️⃣ Go to https://www.hcaptcha.com/accessibility and click on "If you are an accessibility user, please sign up here."

2️⃣ Enter any email address (it must be real, as you will receive an email link) and click the "Get Accessibility Cookie" link in your email - You can bookmark this link for easy access in future.

3️⃣ Set the cookie.
