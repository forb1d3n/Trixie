😁 VM WINDOWS : HOW TO BYPASS MICROSOFT LOGIN AT INSTALLATION 😁

1️⃣ Make sure you are on the "Enter your Microsoft email" part, so that you have to setup Microsoft.

2️⃣ Go on VirtualBox to "Devices" > "Network" and click "Connect Network Adapter" to disable it.

3️⃣ Then click on the back-arrow (←) to go one step back and then you will be forwarded again to "Enter your name".

Now you can put any name and then continue without Microsoft Login 🔥❤️
